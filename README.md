# Instructions

## 1. Add Data
- Download the following four data files and place them in the folder:
  - `X3_mon_data.pkl`, `X4_mon_data.pkl` (Extract from `X3_X4_mon_data.zip`)
  - `mon_standard.pkl`, `unmon_standard10.pkl`

## 2. Set Data Path
- For OpenWorld.ipynb and ClosedWorld.ipynb, enter the path where the data files are located into the path variable under the "Preparation" section at the top of the file.
- For s_final_categorical.ipynb, check the # File Path Setup section and enter the path into the path variable.

## 3. Run
- Execute the script as instructed.
